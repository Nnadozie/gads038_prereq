prettier with eslint

- had eslint airbnb-base
- had to get eslint-config-prettier to turn off conflicting rules
- had to use vscode workplace settingst to turn on format on save
- decided not to install a prettierr package but rely on my vscode extension
- had to make sure prettierr was default editor for js files to format js files using the .prettierrc config
- also made sure I didn't have a global prettier file
